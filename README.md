# Real-Time Game Tycoon (RTGT)

This game is a final project for a Computer Networks class, taken in Spring 2019 at New College of Florida, with Professor Lepinski. For this project we were assigned to choose a topic that we did not greatly cover in class and to present the topic in whatever medium we would like. We could do this in groups up to 4 people. I chose to do it independently.

For my project I decided to research more about Real-Time Gaming Over IP. This includes the different structures and models real-time games use to achieve functionality. For the my medium I decided to create an educational simulation game. In this game the player learns about each basic real-time game structure through simulating them on their network. There is also a game aspect to this simulation, for the player can develop and implement these models with cost and watch their profits increase due to the effectiveness of the model.

This game was made using [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), a Java based game framework.
I created and own all assets and property of this game, except for the code from the libGDX library.

To RUN and PLAY the game download the RealTimeGameGame.jar file from the releases page: https://github.com/janfic/RealTimeGameGame/releases/tag/v1.0
